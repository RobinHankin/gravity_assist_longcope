This repo contains R code to create a camera-ready PDF of the velocity-space map of Keplerian orbits, following D. Longcope (2020).  "Using Kepler's laws and Rutherford scattering to chart the seven gravity assists in the epic sunward journey of the Parker Solar Probe".  _American Journal of Physics_, volume 88, number 11, pages 11-19.  It also presents an inverted diagram giving planetocentric velocity contours as a function of perihelion and aphelion.
